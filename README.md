# Marketing

These are the marketing pages for Dev Desk Q. There are 3 pages with mostly unified styling on both and a shared header/footer:

[The Home Page](https://dev-desk-q.netlify.app/index.html)
- Contains banner of sorts at the top containing two image and two text sections, a link to login/sign-up, and a link "meet the team".

[The About (Our-Team) Page](https://dev-desk-q.netlify.app/about.html)
- Contains images and job descriptions on the team members.

[Contact Us Page](https://dev-desk-q.netlify.app/contact.html)
- Contains a contact form. The Contact Us page does not currently have a fully functioning contact us form, but it does have the required HTML and Styling for it.

It was designed responsively using flexbox, percentage values, 3 breakpoints, and rem/em sizing. All pages (at least in the header/footer) link to the projects main application from the Login/Sign button.
